                            For the last few years of my life, I have devoted myself to the world of chess. I played in numerous different tournaments all across the nation, and climbed up to the highest non-professional level in China. I believe that chess is a sport that granted me countless different benefits, like greatly enhancing my logical thinking skills and helping me establish a mindset that will significantly stress less under pressure. I plan on pursuing chess at least until the end of high school, and take my chess dreams to a whole new level. I always look forward to shattering my old records and setting new limits, creating the best version of myself.

                            Ever since 2021, I climbed onto the wonderful journey of golf. Every week, I would practice golf at the local club, and with the time and effort that I spent came the improvement of my skills. From playing golf, I learned the importance of patience. In a sport where you have to think about your every step before all your shots, without truly calming down, you could never improve. Golf made me realize that life is the same. When there are problems, you just have to calm down, think, and proceed. I believe that golf will continue to play a significant part of my life in the future, and I look forward to improving my skills even further.

                            I have been playing badminton since the summer of 2023. Ever since, I immediately felt the impact that it made towards my life. I remember that every time I tried learning a new move, I would fail, but deep down inside, I knew that all my struggles would eventually lead to success, so I never gave up. I tried again and again, getting up after each failed attempt. As time went on, I started to become more confident in myself, my moves were looking more fluent, and I was progressing rapidly. For the future, I wish to practice more and become the best badminton player in the school.

                            In December of 2023, I got my first road bike. From then on, I was determined to become the fastest cycler I could be. As of right now, I have completed 40 laps around the Jiangxinzhou island, which is approximately 22 km per lap. Every single lap, I try to push myself to the limit. Currently, my best time is a few seconds over 50 minutes, and I am currently trying to break through the 50 minute barrier. One special thing that I have noticed while cycling is that it can really take away the pressure built up inside of me. Every time I step on the pedals, it feels like I'm escaping the world of academics, as all the built up tension inside of me gradually flys out of my body.

                            At the end of grade 7, I was awarded the Middle School PE Award. I believe that I managed to get this award not because of my extraordinary PE skills, but because of my hard work in class. Although I’m not really good at certain sports like basketball and soccer, I would still always try my best and work to improve the skills in PE that I lack. For example, I remember during the lifting unit, I was outmatched by almost all of my peers, as they were bigger and stronger than me. Even though I couldn't lift as heavy weights as the others, I was always among the ones who worked the hardest, and I gave in all I had. PE classes also made me realize that even though people can be born differently, with hard work, anyone can improve and build towards their goals.

                            Website development has always been a hobby for me. I first encountered this topic during computer science class last year in grade 7, and it has stuck with me ever since. I genuinely believe that website development is a powerful tool that when used correctly could alter the lives of innumerable people. Class time is limited, so I would often try to learn about website coding languages like HTML and CSS on my own. Developing websites helped me better enhance my ability to self-study, as I had to search online for a lot of the website creating techniques that aren’t taught in class. I really look forward to creating impactful websites for the public to use.
